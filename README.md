angular-phonegap-seed
=====================

A barebones seed project for getting started with [PhoneGap](phonegap.com) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) (with routing!)

Built using [PhoneGap-CLI](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-cli/):
* Target: iOS 6
* Cordova: 2.9.0

This project also includes a service for wrapping calls to Cordova APIs as presented by Brian Ford in [this awesome blog post](http://briantford.com/blog/angular-phonegap.html).
